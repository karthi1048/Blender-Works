# Welcome to My Blender-Works Repository ðŸ‘‹

This repository serves as a central hub for all my Blender projects hosted on GitHub. Here, you'll find links to two repositories which showcase my work, featuring rendered images and abstract looping animations.

Feel free to explore the links below to dive into different aspects of my projects:

- [**Blender Renders**](https://github.com/karthi1048/Blender-Renders.git) : This repository contains rendered images of my Blender projects in `.png` or `.jpg` formats and abstract & loopable animations in `.mp4` format created either using the Eevee or Cycles render engines.
  
- [**Blender Files**](https://github.com/karthi1048/Blender-files.git) : Access the original `.blend` project files, available for download, so you can explore and modify them yourself.
